    - Dev server

    - Hot reloading: As you make changes to your code, Parcel automatically rebuilds the changed files    and updates your app in the browser.By default, Parcel fully reloads the page, but in some cases it may perform Hot Module Replacement (HMR). HMR improves the development experience by updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh

    - Development target:When using the dev server, only a single target can be built at once. By default, Parcel uses a development target that supports modern browsers. This means that transpilation of modern JavaScript syntax for older browsers is disabled.

    - Caching:Parcel caches everything it builds to disk. If you restart the dev server, Parcel will only rebuild files that have changed since the last time it ran. Parcel automatically tracks all of the files, configuration, plugins, and dev dependencies that are involved in your build, and granularly invalidates the cache when something changes. For example, if you change a configuration file, all of the source files that rely on that configuration will be rebuilt.

    - HTTPS:Sometimes, you may need to use HTTPS during development. For example, you may need to use a certain hostname for authentication cookies, or debug mixed content issues. Parcelâ€™s dev server supports HTTPS out of the box. You can either use an automatically generated certificate, or provide your own.
